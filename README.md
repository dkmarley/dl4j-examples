# Deeplearning4j NLP examples
A Clojure port of some of the NLP examples for Deeplearning4j. So far, there are implementations of Word2Vec and 
Paragraph2Vec.

## Usage
Clone and then see the code in the 'comment' section for classifier.clj, sentences.clj & raw-text.clj. classifier.clj is
the most interesting as it has an example for classification and also using the word vectors from the trained model with
quite impressive results from such a small training set.
