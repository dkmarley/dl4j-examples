# Deeplearning4j NLP examples
A Clojure port of some of the NLP examples for Deeplearning4j. So far, there are implementations of Word2Vec,
Paragraph2Vec/Doc2Vec, SequenceVectors and GloVe.

## Usage
Clone and then run the code in the 'comment' section in your REPL. The most interesting is the Paragrah2Vec classifier 
as it has an example for classification and also using the word vectors from the trained model with quite impressive 
results for such a small training set.
